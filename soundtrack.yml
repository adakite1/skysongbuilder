## These are advanced options, use with care. Leave it as it is for normal usage.
### WAVI_POINTER_EXTENSION
###  - This flag extends the 16-bit pointers used by the sample bank WAVI chunks to use 32-bit pointers instead. Only generated files are modified, input swd files can have either, and SkySongBuilder will read them accordingly.
###  - Effects: Increases the number of samples allowed in each bank file to around 65,535 samples (theoretical, untested). (applicable to the massive main bank)
###  - Requirements: The `MoreSamplesAndPresets` patch (requires `ExtraSpace`)
### PRGI_POINTER_EXTENSION
###  - This flag extends the 16-bit pointers used by the sample bank PRGI chunks to use 32-bit pointers instead. Only generated files are modified, input swd files can have either, and SkySongBuilder will read them accordingly.
###  - Effects: Increases the number and size of presets allowed in each bank file.
###  - Requirements: The `MoreSamplesAndPresets` patch (requires `ExtraSpace`)

  # Note that in-engine songs and raw audio songs can co-exist in the same configuration and in the game's music directory with no problems.


# P.s. if the game shows a black screen for an in-engine track, that track uses too many samples and has caused a lack of memory error in the game.
# Note that since raw audio songs take up around 1/3 of the built-in engine's memory, some built-in tracks might also cause a lack of memory error if played together with a streamed track.
